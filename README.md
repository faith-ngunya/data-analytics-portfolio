 Key Analysis Performed
- Overall sales and profit performance
- Category and sub-category profitability

Key Insights
Despite generating strong overall sales, the superstore records a profit margin of 12.47%. This indicates moderate profitability and suggests the presence of cost pressures, discounting inefficiencies, and pricing challenges.
Several sub-categories, particularly Tables and Bookcases, generate consistent losses despite contributing to overall sales, negatively impacting total profitability.
Higher discount levels are associated with lower profitability, indicating that aggressive discounting erodes margins rather than driving profitable growth.

The West region contributes the highest profit, while the Central region


 Business Recommendations
- Reduce excessive discounting on low-margin products
- Re-evaluate pricing for loss-making sub-categories
