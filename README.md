Superstore Sales & Profitability Analysis (Excel)

 Project Overview
This project analyzes sales performance, profitability, and customer behavior
using a retail superstore dataset. The goal is to identify profit drivers,
loss-making products, and provide actionable business recommendations.

 Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel
- Pivot Tables
- Data Cleaning & Calculated Fields

Dataset
- Source: Superstore retail dataset- kaggle
- Records: 9,000+ transactions
- Key fields: Sales, Profit, Discount, sub-Category, Region

 Key Analysis Performed
- Overall sales and profit performance
- Category and sub-category profitability
- Discount vs profit analysis
- region vs profit vs sales
- ship mode vs profit

Key Insights
Despite generating strong overall sales, the superstore records a profit margin of 12.47%. This indicates moderate profitability and suggests the presence of cost pressures, discounting inefficiencies, and pricing challenges.
Several sub-categories, particularly Tables and Bookcases, generate consistent losses despite contributing to overall sales, negatively impacting total profitability.
Higher discount levels are associated with lower profitability, indicating that aggressive discounting erodes margins rather than driving profitable growth.
The West region contributes the highest profit, while the Central region underperforms.
Standard Class shipping generates the highest profit margins.


 Business Recommendations
Moderate overall profitability (12.47% margin): Focus on cost management and operational efficiency to improve margins across all products.

Loss-making sub-categories (Tables & Bookcases): Re-evaluate pricing, reduce costs, or consider discontinuing consistently unprofitable items.

High discount levels reduce profitability: Limit aggressive discounting and adopt targeted promotions for high-margin products.

Regional performance differences: Apply successful strategies from the West region to improve profitability in underperforming regions like Central.

Shipping profitability (Standard Class highest): Encourage use of high-margin shipping options and optimize logistics to reduce costlier alternatives.
